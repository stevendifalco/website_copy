I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Natural Resources at the University of Connecticut, where I am studying the human dimensions of roadside vegetation management. My research project involved a survey mailed to residents of Connecticut, to understand public perceptions and opinons towards tree management. I used spatial analysis to evaluate how attitudes vary spatially. I am interested in the interaction between humans and natural resources, and how this shapes their approval of management decisions. While at UConn, I have honed my skills in ArcGIS/ArcOnline and developed an understanding of statistical softwares such as R, Python, and SPSS.

For five years, I worked as a natural resource specialist to restore native ecosystems through invasive plant management. I focused on restoring forests and fields to their native composition. I collected and propogated native plants to aid in this process, and return locally extripated species. I am interested in the way exotic invasive species affect local ecosystems, and best management practices to mitigate their impacts. One of the most important parts of land management is the reestablishment of native plant populations. Restoring and maintaining native plant populations is important for helping provide habitat for our native pollinators
