<h5>This is the second post to using the Urban Ranger Response Call from NYC Open Data (first post)[<a href="https://www.stevendifalco.com/post/nyc-urban-ranger-animal-response/" class="uri">https://www.stevendifalco.com/post/nyc-urban-ranger-animal-response/</a>]. The data did not have specific location information, such as XY coordinates, but there was a field <code>Property</code> in the database. Using this field, I decided to try out geocoding the information in ArcGIS Online.</h5>

<h5>To start, let’s read in the data. In viewing the first 10 rows, I already see we might have some cleaning needed for this column also. “WashingtoM” vs “WashingtoN” Square Park.</h5>

<h5>I decided to try out using (Open Refine)[<a href="https://openrefine.org/" class="uri">https://openrefine.org/</a>] to clean up the data instead of trying to use R.

<h5>Using the Facet feature on the Property Column, we can group together like text. Using Cluster and Nearest Neighbor function, we get the pop-up below. I went through different types of clustering to merge similar properties names together. I also did the step above for <code>species.description</code> and <code>animal.class</code> to refine these columns. <em>Last</em> step, add a column for <code>State</code> and put New York for all entries- reason will be clear below. Export this csv file.</h5>

<h5>Now to bring this over to ArcOnline to geocode! But one final step is needed first; creating a layer which allows ArcOnline to query location names for geocoding.
