#### Using the TidyTuesday Art History Data, I've created two plots. One is a `ggstream` plot organized by artist_race in the dataset.

![](ArtByRace.png){width = 100%}

#### The seocnd is using `ggwaffle` organized by country. For the second, I recategorized the artist_nationaltity field to country, thinking I could get flags to represent the boxes in the plot, but this did not pan out. Either way, quite happy with the way these figures turned out. This is the featured image above.
