<h4>I have always been very interested in keeping track of my workout activities, especially since I got an Apple Watch. This has really propelled me to become very obsessed with tracking nearly all my walks and hikes. It’s really fascinating to see over the past three years how often I would achieve my daily activity goals. There are also some big gaps in the data when I often did not wear my watch and was not as active.</h4>

<h4>In January 2022, I adopted a dog. This started a daily habit of daily or twice-daily walks/hikes; the perfect things to record. I also joined a gym in April 2022, again another time for data collection. The Apple Health data has a TON of records to parse through. In the <code>record</code> category, I had over 1,000,000 rows of data going back to 2015- I decided to not explore that data just yet. For this post, I focused on <code>workout</code> records including the Exercise, Move, and Stand daily goals.</h4>

<h4>The result of the code below is this figure. Clearly, 2022 was a much more successful year according to my watch activity records with 2020 second and 2021 third. I’ll be posting more from this dataset overtime.</h4>
