## This is my contribution to [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/) 

### In this, I'm attempting to use the gganimate package for the first time to create an animation showing volcanoe eruptions over the past century and their location.

### Packages used for this document:

```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
#this gets rid most of the outputs that are not necessary for making the mapping
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T,
                      results = "hide",
                      error=FALSE, 
                      warning=FALSE,
                      message=FALSE) 

```

```{r include=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(maps)
library(ggthemes)
library(DT)
library(gifski)
```

## Lets take a look at the data first and see what information is here.  

```{r}
eruptions <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/eruptions.csv')

eruption_list <- eruptions %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-contains("modifier"), -contains("uncertainty")) %>%
  filter(eruption_category == "Confirmed Eruption") %>%
  drop_na(end_year) %>%
  filter(end_year > 2010)

datatable(eruption_list, rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5))

```


## Next, I'll create an underlying map for plotting the points. 

```{r}
world <- ggplot() +
  borders("world", colour = "gray85", fill = "gray80") +
  theme_map() 

map <- world +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, size = vei),
             data = eruption_list, 
             colour = 'purple', alpha = .5) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 7)) +
  labs(size = 'Volcanic Explosivity Index')

map
```

## Now let's animate! I did not realize going into this that the points would 'move' from year to year instead of appearing for that year then disappear. Something to consider for the next time I use this package. 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

animate2 <- world + 
    geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, size = vei),
             data = eruption_list, 
             colour = 'purple', alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Date: {frame_time}", size = "Volcanic Index") +
  transition_time(end_year) +
  ease_aes("linear")

animate(animate, renderer = gifski_renderer("volcanobyyear.gif"))

```
